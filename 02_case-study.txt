Our IT company embarked on an ambitious project in January 2024 aimed at delivering a cutting-edge software solution to our users and clients. 
The project was meticulously planned with a target launch date of June 1. However, as the deadline approaches, 
it becomes apparent that several tasks are still in progress, and there are unresolved bugs that need attention. 
The testing process, crucial for ensuring product quality, has not yet begun. As a software engineer involved in the project, 
what aspects could have been handled better to prevent the delays and issues experienced, such as incomplete tasks, 
unresolved bugs, and a delayed testing process?

For this activity, evaluate the situation and offer your suggestions on areas where improvements could have been made.

Answer:
As I analyze the problem, it lacks a clear approach. Therefore, I suggest that an agile approach is better for this specific issue. 
When a developer is given a task, they estimate the hours needed based on their capacity. 
If the task is still in progress beyond the deadline, it is their responsibility because they estimated the time required. 
When this happens, it signals that someone needs to help them finish the task and move on to the next one 
so the whole project can be completed by the specific deadline. 
Additionally, it's better to test the software early, even if it's not finished, because waiting until the end wastes time. 
By testing early, errors can be found and fixed sooner.
